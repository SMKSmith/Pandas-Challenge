# Pandas Challenge

## Background
In this scenario, I'm the new Chief Data Scientist for PyCity's school district helping the school board and mayor by analyzing their schools performance. My analysis will allow them to make foundational decisions for school budgets and educational initatives.

The dataset provided was the district-wide standardized testing results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as the schools they attend and school budgets.
