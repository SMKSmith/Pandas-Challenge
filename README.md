# Pandas Challenge

## Background
In this scenario, I'm the new Chief Data Scientist for PyCity's school district helping the school board and mayor by analyzing their schools performance. My analysis will allow them to make foundational decisions for school budgets and educational initatives.

The dataset provided was the district-wide standardized testing results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as the schools they attend and school budgets. 

## PyCity Schools

The following is the breakdown of the analysis:

### District Summary

* Total number of unique schools

* Total students

* Total budget

* Average math score

* Average reading score

* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### School Summary

* School name

* School type

* Total students

* Total school budget

* Per student budget

* Average math score

* Average reading score

* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

### Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

### Math Scores by Grade

### Reading Scores by Grade

### Scores by School Spending

Include the following metrics in the table:

* Average math score

* Average reading score

* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Scores by School Size

### Scores by School Type

### Final Analysis

In this project I analyzed the test results for the district and charter schools. The data consisted of every student's math and reading scores. Additional information that was provided was the school size, the amount of attending students, and the budget for each school. The conclusion from this data set shows more funding does not amount to better education. The data provided did not expand past a year. The results from the analysis may differ if addtional years of data were provided for this analysis.

* Overall,  charter schools performed higher than district schools with both math and reading test scores. This could be attributed to the smaller class sizes with charter schools compared to the larger class sizes with district school. The smaller class sizes allow a more condusive learning environment for students.

* Even though district schools had higher budgets (per student) than charter schools they still had 59% less students passing overall. This shows the ineffective teaching methods in district schools compared to charter schools.
