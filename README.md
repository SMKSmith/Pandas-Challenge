## Background
In this scenario, I'm the new Chief Data Scientist for PyCity's school district helping the school board and mayor by analyzing their schools performance. My analysis will allow them to make foundational decisions for school budgets and educational initatives.

The dataset provided was the district-wide standardized testing results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as the schools they attend and school budgets. 

## PyCity Schools

The following is the breakdown of the analysis:

### District Summary

* Total number of unique schools

* Total students

* Total budget

* Average math score

* Average reading score

* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### School Summary

* School name

* School type

* Total students

* Total school budget

* Per student budget

* Average math score

* Average reading score

* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

### Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

### Math Scores by Grade

### Reading Scores by Grade

### Scores by School Spending

Include the following metrics in the table:

* Average math score

* Average reading score

* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
